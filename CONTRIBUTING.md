## Engaging with this project

TODO: Add links below to your repo's GitHub Issues and Discussions pages.

Here are some important resources:
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/iq-github-action/issues) - a place for bugs to be raised and feature requests made
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/iq-github-action/discussions)) - a place to discuss ideas or real-world usage

### Coding Conventions

- In order to help verify the authenticity of contributed code, we ask that your [commits be signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). 
  All commits must be signed off to show that you agree to publish your changes under the current terms and licenses of the project.
  
  Here are some notes we found helpful in configuring a local environment to automatically sign git commits:
    - [GPG commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification#gpg-commit-signature-verification)
    - [Telling Git about your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-gpg-key)

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using `action-docs`.
